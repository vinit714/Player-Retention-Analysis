review
I love this game but it crashes too often.
Too many bugs in the last update.
"Gameplay is fun, but matchmaking is slow."
No new content in months. Boring now.
"Best graphics, smooth gameplay. Addictive!"
Server lag makes it hard to enjoy.
Great community and frequent events.
Needs better tutorial for new players.
"Love the skins, hate the paywall."
Game balance feels off after the update.
